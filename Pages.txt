LEADING THE WAY
MSU's nationally recognized neighborhoods initiative brings critical resources to first-year students right where they live, with the goal of giving every student admitted to MSU an equal opportunity to graduate and succeed. Resources provided in the neighborhoods are organized into four key developmental areas: academic, health and wellness, intercultural, and residential.
The neighborhood initiative is working, as MSU boasts one of the nation's highest freshman retention rates.
ENGAGEMENT CENTERS
The Engagement Centers are unique spaces located in each neighborhood and serve as the main access points to important resources such as tutors, neighborhood advisors, health practitioners, and other consultants that can help students navigate through their college career. Students can go there to:
Get questions answered
Find assistance with math coursework, writing papers, and other academic subjects
Sign up for recreation and fitness programs
Make an appointment with the health clinic
Get advice
Learn about upcoming events in and around your neighborhood
Socialize with friends
Each week, the Engagement Center hosts individual and group tutoring for many first and second year courses, social and cultural activities, as well as fitness classes for Yoga, Cardio Kick Boxing, and Zumba.  In addition, there are workshops on practical topics such as using the library, sharpening study skills, searching for internships, managing personal finances and more. Students will even find technical assistance for troubleshooting problems with a personal computer.

Michigan State University’s diverse community challenges us to share our own ideas while considering other points of view. Here, differences are assets. They make us better learners, teachers, scholars, employees and community members.
Many resources are available to support MSU’s students:
The Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives serves as the university’s focal point for promoting inclusion and diversity on campus. Learn more about MSU’s inclusive heritage and our diverse campus.
The Office of Cultural and Academic Transitions constructs supportive social and educational communities that actively involve students in learning by bringing together individuals and groups from diverse racial, ethnic, international, and domestic backgrounds.
The Office for International Students and Scholars supports international students on campus and provides guidance to the university’s international student clubs.
The LBGT Resource Center leads and collaborates on university-wide initiatives that enhance campus climate and academic and support services for students who identify as lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender and/or transsexual, and their communities.
The MSU Student Parent Resource Center helps students and families balance work, educational, and family responsibilities.

Safety
Safety is important to Michigan State University, and all members of the campus community—students, faculty, and staff—are encouraged to take an active role in preventing and reporting incidents that jeopardize safety on and around campus.
Michigan State has more than 80 sworn police officers certified by the State of Michigan on campus. Additional campus safety and security services include late night transport/escort service, 24-hour emergency telephones, lighted pathways/sidewalks and controlled residence hall access.
Annual Security and Fire Safety Report
MSU, in compliance with a federal law called "the Clery Act," publishes an Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which provides MSU students and employees (both current and prospective) with information about the campus, police and public safety resources, reporting crimes, fire and medical emergencies, crime and fire prevention, victim support services, crime statistics, fire statistics, the crime and fire log, the University’s Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Policy, the MSU Drug and Alcohol Policy and more. You can access the report below. A hard copy of this document may be obtained by contacting the Department of Student Life at (517) 355-8286, or e-mail stulife@msu.edu.
  MSU'S ANNUAL SECURITY AND FIRE SAFETY REPORT
Our Commitment
MSU is committed to cultivating a safe and inclusive campus community characterized by caring and respect for others. This promise extends to you whether you are a student, faculty or staff member, patient or visitor.
Emergency alert system
In accordance with the Clery Act, the MSU Police Department operates an emergency notification system through email, text message or voice message to phones with campus safety warnings and information. Parents and guardians are welcome to subscribe to MSU Alerts to receive the same messages.
The MSU campus also is equipped with a mass notification outdoor speaker system to launch severe weather warning sirens and/or an audible message detailing actions to take.
Residence halls
Residence hall rooms feature hard-wired smoke detectors and fire-rated room and wing doors. Residents regularly participate in fire drills. All room doors have peepholes, and night receptionists are in place to see that only building residents or guests signed in by residents and taking responsibility for them are allowed in the building after hours. All halls have security cameras in the lobby.
Late night safety
In addition to MSU’s extensive campus bus system, the Night Owl service provides late night transportation on campus after the buses stop running at 2 a.m. In addition, students can use StateWalk, an on-campus nighttime walking service in which pairs of volunteers will walk with individuals between on-campus destinations.

CAMPUS TRANSPORTATION
Michigan State University covers more than 5,000 acres and is one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. Besides walking, students have many options for getting around campus, including many green transportation options. 
Bikes
With more than half of its roads equipped with bike lanes and more than 20,000 bicycle parking spaces, MSU has been named a Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists.
Additionally, MSU has installed several bike repair stations across campus, providing cyclists with a place to fix flats and make minor adjustments. MSU’s Bikes Service Center also offers a range of services for individuals or campus departments looking to rent, repair, buy or equip a bike.
Students who bring a bike to campus must obtain a free bicycle permit from the MSU Police Department.
Campus bus system
The Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) bus system is free for all students during fall and spring semesters along all on-campus routes. These routes serve all university apartments, residence halls, commuter lots and main campus facilities. Most on-campus routes run until 2:30 a.m. after which the Night Owl service provides late night transportation at a discounted student rate. In addition to the free on-campus routes, there are also routes that extend to the surrounding off-campus areas of East Lansing, Lansing, Okemos and Haslett. For off-campus routes, students can pay per ride or purchase passes.
Cars
MSU offers seven Zipcar parking locations on campus. Students 18 years and older, including drivers with an international license, can rent a car to use by the hour or day.
Students wishing to bring their own car to campus must follow these criteria:
An MSU student not residing on campus property may register a vehicle as a commuter.
An MSU student who resides on campus must have at least 28 credits in order to register their vehicle to park on campus. These 28 credits can be AP credits earned while in highschool, credits transferred from another 2 or 4 year institution or earned while at MSU.
When eligible, students may purchase a parking permit on campus and register their vehicle through the MSU Police Department.
Mopeds
Mopeds are another popular form of transportation on campus. MSU has numerous moped-designated parking spaces across campus for your convenience. To see where moped spaces are located, zoom in on the MSU interactive map to see the small purple squares marking the spaces. In order to use a moped on campus, you must purchase a parking permit after having registered your moped with the Secretary of State Office.
One advantage over cars is that MSU allows students to use mopeds starting their first year on campus. Students wishing to drive a car on campus must either be a commuter student or in at least their second year at MSU. More information about mopeds can be found on the MSU police website.

Need-based aid
It is challenging for many families to pay full educational costs from current income or savings. If you require financial assistance, your first step is to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online as soon as possible after October 1 of the year before you plan to enroll. FAFSA evaluates eligibility for need-based aid, including federal loans, and gives students access to need-based grants, scholarships, loans and work-study.
MSU does not have a separate financial aid application; however, aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are exhausted based upon receipt of the FAFSA. If there has been a change to your family's financial status since you completed the FAFSA, U.S. citizens and permanent residents can complete the Special Condition Application (SCA) and submit documentation to confirm a change in funding.  
International students are not eligible to receive financial aid through FAFSA; however, the Office of Financial Aid does provide suggestions for international students seeking additional financial resources.

Return on investment
What matters most when choosing a university—graduation rates, the cost of a degree or return on investment? At MSU, you don’t have to choose. In 2018, Money magazine cited all three in ranking Michigan State one of Money’s Best Colleges.
Each year, nearly 600 top organizations conduct more than 15,000 interviews on the MSU campus. Recent interviewers included Boeing, Campbell-Ewald Advertising, Fiat Chrysler, General Electric, IBM, Morgan Stanley, PepsiCo, Peace Corps, Pfizer, Teach for America and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
MSU’s Career Services Network aids students with a range of services, including career advising, deciding on a major, attaining internships and, eventually, finding full-time work or graduate/professional study opportunities.
